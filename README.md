## Frontend is written using Nextjs in React typescript with Apollo for caching and the link between frontend and backend. Material UI is used to style the website.

## Backend is written in typescript and headless CMS Keystone is along with the MongoDB database. 

## It is deployed on Digital Ocean.

## Users can:
+ Create an account
+ Manage their own todos. Add them, edit them, delete them.
+ MongoDB is used to store data so it persists.

It's completely caching the data and makes use of Nextjs file based routing and server side rendering for performance.
